                For this position I worked with children between the ages of 17 months to 7 years old. During my two daily sessions, I
                ran various programs and task analyses assigned by the client's BCBA, along with pairing, to contribute to the
                improvement of the child's social, communication, attention, and language skills. In addition, I took clinical notes and
                data on the accuracy of program or task analysis completion as well as behavioral frequencies to determine if anything
                had to be altered to best suit the client's ability to succeed.

                In this position I assisted the professor in various manners. In preparing for the lab, I set up models, microscopes and
                slides, or animals models with the proper dissection equipment. During the course of the lab, I helped answer students
                questions and gathered extra materials as needed. I also assisted in setting up lab practical exams and hosted study
                sessions for students to come into the lab and ask questions on models or animal models in the days before the exam.
